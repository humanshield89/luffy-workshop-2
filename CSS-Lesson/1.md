# CSS

To style our HTML pages, we use CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is a language that describes the style of an HTML document. CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.

CSS is a cornerstone technology of the web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation improves content accessibility, provides more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enables multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content.

CSS can be added to HTML documents in three ways:

* **Inline:** CSS is added directly to HTML elements using the `style` attribute.
```html
<!-- Example -->
<p style="color: red;">This is a paragraph.</p>
``
```
* **Internal:** CSS is added to the `<head>` section of an HTML document using the `<style>` tag.
```html
<!-- Example -->
<head>
    <style>
        p {
            color: red;
        }
    </style>
</head>
```
*  **External:** CSS is added to a separate .css file and linked to the HTML document using the `<link>` tag.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
```
```css
/* style.css */
p {
    color: red;
}
```

## CSS Syntax

CSS is a rule-based language. Each rule consists of a selector and a declaration block. The selector points to the HTML element to be styled, and the declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.

```css
[selector] { 
    /* Declaration block */
    [property]: [value];
}
```

## Basic CSS Selectors

CSS selectors are used to select the HTML elements to be styled. There are many different types of selectors, including:

* **Element:** Selects all elements of a given type.
```css

p {
    color: red;
}
```
* **Class:** Selects all elements with a given class.
```css

.red-text {
    color: red;
}
```
* **ID:** Selects a single element with a given ID.
```css

#red-text {
    color: red;
}
```

## Pseudo-classes

Pseudo-classes are used to define a special state of an element. For example, the `:hover` pseudo-class is used to apply a style when a user hovers over an element with their mouse.

```css

a:hover {
    color: red;
}
```

```css
/* nth-child */
li:nth-child(2) {
    color: red;
}

/* first-child */
li:first-child {
    color: red;
}

/* last-child */
li:last-child {
    color: red;
}

/* nth-of-type */
li:nth-of-type(2) {
    color: red;
}
```

## CSS Comments

Comments are used to add notes to CSS code. Comments are not displayed on the webpage and can help explain code to others.

```css
/* This is a CSS comment */
```

## CSS Colors

Colors can be specified in CSS using a variety of formats, including:

* **Color Names:** CSS supports a variety of color names, including `red`, `blue`, `green`, `yellow`, `orange`, `purple`, `black`, `white`, `gray`, `brown`, `pink`, `teal`, `cyan`, `magenta`, `lime`, `olive`, `navy`, `maroon`, `silver`, and `gold`.
```css

p {
    color: red;
}
```
* **Hexadecimal:** Hexadecimal colors are specified using the format `#RRGGBB`, where `RR` is the red value, `GG` is the green value, and `BB` is the blue value. Each value is represented by a two-digit hexadecimal number ranging from `00` to `FF`.
```css

p {
    color: #FF0000;
}
```

* **RGB:** RGB colors are specified using the format `rgb(R, G, B)`, where `R` is the red value, `G` is the green value, and `B` is the blue value. Each value is represented by a number ranging from `0` to `255`.
```css
p {
    color: rgb(255, 0, 0);
}
```

* **RGBA:** RGBA colors are specified using the format `rgba(R, G, B, A)`, where `R` is the red value, `G` is the green value, `B` is the blue value, and `A` is the alpha value. Each value is represented by a number ranging from `0` to `255`. The alpha value represents the opacity of the color, with `0` being completely transparent and `1` being completely opaque.
```css
p {
    color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5);
}
```

* **HSL:** HSL colors are specified using the format `hsl(H, S%, L%)`, where `H` is the hue value, `S` is the saturation value, and `L` is the lightness value. The hue value represents the color, with `0` being red, `120` being green, and `240` being blue. The saturation value represents the intensity of the color, with `0%` being gray and `100%` being fully saturated. The lightness value represents the brightness of the color, with `0%` being black, `50%` being normal, and `100%` being white.
```css
p {
    color: hsl(0, 100%, 50%);
}
```

* **HSLA:** HSLA colors are specified using the format `hsla(H, S%, L%, A)`, where `H` is the hue value, `S` is the saturation value, `L` is the lightness value, and `A` is the alpha value. The hue value represents the color, with `0` being red, `120` being green, and `240` being blue. The saturation value represents the intensity of the color, with `0%` being gray and `100%` being fully saturated. The lightness value represents the brightness of the color, with `0%` being black, `50%` being normal, and `100%` being white. The alpha value represents the opacity of the color, with `0` being completely transparent and `1` being completely opaque.
```css
p {
    color: hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.5);
}
```

## CSS Length Units

Length units are used to specify the size of elements in CSS. There are many different types of length units, including:

* **Pixels:** Pixels are a unit of length equal to one pixel on a screen. Pixels are commonly used to specify the size of elements on a webpage.
```css
p {
    font-size: 16px;
}
```

* **Percentages:** Percentages are a unit of length equal to a percentage of the parent element's size. Percentages are commonly used to create responsive designs.
```css
p {
    font-size: 100%;
}
```

* **Viewport Units:** Viewport units are a unit of length equal to a percentage of the viewport's size. The viewport is the visible area of the webpage, and the viewport units are relative to the viewport's size.
```css
p {
    width: 100vw; /* 100% of viewport width */
    height: 100vh; /* 100% of viewport height */
}
```

* **Em:** Em is a unit of length equal to the computed font size of the element. Em is commonly used to specify the size of elements relative to the font size of their parent element.
```css
p {
    font-size: 1em;
}
```

* **Rem:** Rem is a unit of length equal to the computed font size of the root element. Rem is commonly used to specify the size of elements relative to the font size of the root element.
```css
p {
    font-size: 1rem;
}
```

* **Ch:** Ch is a unit of length equal to the width of the character `0` in the element's font. Ch is commonly used to specify the size of elements relative to the width of a character.
```css
p {
    width: 10ch;
}
```


## Box Model

The box model is a model used to describe the layout of elements in CSS. The box model consists of four parts: margin, border, padding, and content.

![Box Model](https://www.w3schools.com/css/box-model.gif)

* **Margin:** The margin is the space between the element and other elements.
```css
p {
    margin: 10px;
}
```

* **Border:** The border is the line around the element.
```css
p {
    border: 1px solid black;
}
```

* **Padding:** The padding is the space between the element and its content.
```css
p {
    padding: 10px;
}
```

* **Content:** The content is the actual content of the element.
```css
p {
    color: red;
}
```

* **box-sizing:** The box-sizing property is used to control how the width and height of an element are calculated. By default, the width and height of an element are calculated based on the content, padding, and border. However, the box-sizing property can be used to include the margin in the calculation.
```css
p {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

## Display Property

The display property is used to control how an element is displayed. There are many different display values, including:

* **Block:** Block-level elements are displayed as blocks and take up the full width of the page. Block-level elements are commonly used for page layout.
```css
p {
    display: block;
}
```

* **Inline:** Inline elements are displayed inline and take up only as much width as necessary. Inline elements are commonly used for text.
```css
p {
    display: inline;
}
```

* **Inline-block:** Inline-block elements are displayed inline but can have a width and height. Inline-block elements are commonly used for images.
```css
p {
    display: inline-block;
}
```

* **None:** Elements with a display value of none are not displayed at all. None is commonly used to hide elements.
```css
p {
    display: none;
}
```

## Position Property

The position property is used to control the position of an element. There are many different position values, including:

* **Static:** Static elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the page. Static is the default position value.
```css
p {
    position: static;
}
```

* **Relative:** Relative elements are positioned relative to their normal position. Relative elements can be moved using the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties.
```css
p {
    position: relative;
    top: 10px;
    left: 10px;
}
```

* **Absolute:** Absolute elements are positioned relative to their closest positioned ancestor. If an absolute element does not have a positioned ancestor, it is positioned relative to the document body. Absolute elements can be moved using the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties.
```css
p {
    position: absolute;
    top: 10px;
    left: 10px;
}
```

* **Fixed:** Fixed elements are positioned relative to the viewport. Fixed elements do not move when the page is scrolled. Fixed elements can be moved using the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties.
```css
p {
    position: fixed;
    top: 10px;
    left: 10px;
